Promote your favorite artist or designer with a one page RESPONSIVE layout.

Your page needs to include all of the following HTML and style the elements using linked CSS:
+ Hyperlinks
+ An ordered or unordered list
+ A placed image using the image tag, and one placed using CSS
+ A table
+ A form

Integrate at least three CSS3 styles in your page.
Consider:
+ Border Radius
+ Box Shadow
+ Text Shadow
+ RGBA
+ @Font Face
+ Multiple Columns
+ Transtions
+ Transform
+ Gradients

Keep it simple. Consider this page like a poster, giving necessary content like important facts about the artist or designer, quotes, and dates.
